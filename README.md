# Motion-Control-System

Tongue operated assistive device made of bio-safe plastic to assist the motion of people with locomotor disorders. The objective of this project was to design a system which makes it easy for people with partial paralysis or locomotor disorders to operate a wheelchair without assistance. The system is worn in the mouth in the form of braces attached to the upper jaw and operated using feedback from touch sensors actuated using the tongue.

Some of the challenges faced were designing the part to fit comfortably in the upper jaw of the user and not cause any discomfort. 

A 3D printed mockup of the part was used to test and present as a part of the project proposal which won 1st place in the hardware category of the Smart India Hackathon.
